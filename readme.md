Adobe AIR ANE for using Appirater in your iOS projects.
=======================================================

The API is nearly a mirror of the original [https://github.com/arashpayan/appirater Appirater] implementation, so you can look its site in order to learn how to use it.

ANE developed for [http://www.paldeveloppers.com/ PalDeveloppers].

Updated with 64-bit support by Kevin Newman

A working ANE build (as of April 2015) is available in the repo, in the Binaries directory.

Build instructions
------------------

You will need Mac OSX with Xcode, a local copy of [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html Adobe AIR SDK], and [http://ant.apache.org/ ant] installed to build. You can get ant from [http://brew.sh/ Homebrew].

1) Edit build-properties. Set AIR_SDK_PATH to the location of the AIR SDK on your local disk.
2) In a terminal window, cd into the root of the project, and type `ant`.

That's it!
